![Price Distribution](charts/01_price_distribution.png)

### What This Shows
The market inventory is distributed across nine price segments, with the strongest concentration in the 10-25K AZN range (5,000+ listings). The market shows healthy distribution across all segments, from budget (<10K) to luxury (>150K).

### Why This Matters

### Business Actions
1. **Dealers**: Focus inventory acquisition in 10-25K range for highest turnover
2. **Lenders**: 66% of market (under 50K) represents prime financing opportunity
3. **Marketers**: Target campaigns differently for sub-25K (volume) vs 50K+ (margin)

## Competitive Landscape

![Brand Market Share](charts/02_brand_volume.png)

### What This Shows
Mercedes leads with 12.6% market share (1,733 listings), followed by Hyundai, Toyota, BMW, and Kia. However, 7,431 listings (54.1%) come from smaller brands, indicating high market fragmentation.

### Why This Matters
- **Market Leader**: Mercedes dominance suggests premium positioning opportunity
- **Value Players**: Hyundai/Kia (combined 20%+) own the mid-market segment
- **Fragmentation**: 54% from smaller brands means no single player controls the market

### Business Actions
1. **Strategic Positioning**: Identify white space between premium (Mercedes/BMW) and value (Hyundai/Kia)
2. **Acquisition Targets**: Smaller brands offer consolidation opportunities
3. **Differentiation**: With high fragmentation, strong branding can capture disproportionate share

---

![Market Concentration](charts/12_market_concentration.png)

### What This Shows
The top 5 brands cumulatively control 45.9% of the market. This concentration curve reveals that while leaders exist, no monopoly controls the market.

### Why This Matters
- **Competitive Market**: No single player can dictate terms
- **Entry Opportunity**: 54% market share available for disruptors
- **Scale Benefits**: Top 5 brands enjoy volume advantages but haven't locked out competitors

### Business Actions
1. **New Entrants**: Market structure allows room for new brands with strong value proposition
2. **Pricing Power**: Avoid direct competition with top 5; focus on differentiation
3. **Partnership Opportunities**: Collaborate with smaller brands for combined market power

---

## Brand Economics

![Brand Pricing](charts/03_brand_pricing.png)

### What This Shows
Average listing prices vary dramatically by brand: from ~22K AZN (Kia, Hyundai) to ~62K AZN (Land Rover, Lexus). Mercedes and BMW occupy the 45-55K range.

### Why This Matters
- **Margin Opportunities**: Premium brands command 2-3x pricing of value brands
- **Market Positioning**: Clear price tiers exist - budget, mid-range, premium, luxury
- **Value Perception**: Korean brands deliver best price/value ratio

### Business Actions
1. **Inventory Strategy**: Balance low-margin/high-volume (Hyundai) vs high-margin/low-volume (Lexus)
2. **Trade-In Programs**: Customers upgrading from Kia (~22K) to Mercedes (~55K) need financing
3. **Market Positioning**: Position new offerings in under-served 30-40K AZN range

---

## Inventory Age Profile

![Vehicle Age Distribution](charts/04_year_trends.png)

### What This Shows
Inventory peaks dramatically for 2024-2025 model years, with secondary peaks around 2016-2018. Very few vehicles older than 2000 are in the market.

### Why This Matters
- **Fresh Inventory**: High volume of recent models indicates active new car market
- **Depreciation Cycle**: 2016-2018 vehicles entering "sweet spot" age for used buyers
- **Age Cutoff**: Vehicles older than 15 years have limited marketability

### Business Actions
1. **Acquisition Focus**: Target 3-7 year old vehicles (2018-2022) for optimal resale
2. **New Car Strategy**: High 2024-2025 inventory suggests competitive new car market
3. **Trade-In Policy**: Vehicles older than 15 years have diminishing return - price accordingly

---

![Value Retention](charts/08_price_depreciation.png)

### What This Shows
Average prices increase sharply from 2005 (~8K AZN) to 2025 (~85K AZN), showing the premium consumers pay for newer vehicles.

### Why This Matters
- **Depreciation Rate**: Vehicles lose ~50% value in first 5 years
- **Value Retention**: After year 10, depreciation slows significantly
- **New Car Premium**: Latest models command 8-10x price of 10-year-old equivalents

### Business Actions
1. **Pricing Models**: Use year-based depreciation curves for accurate valuations
2. **Warranty Programs**: Offer extended warranties on 5-10 year vehicles to command premium pricing
3. **Lease Strategy**: High depreciation in years 1-5 makes leasing financially attractive

---

## Energy Transition Opportunity

![Fuel Type Market](charts/05_fuel_type_market.png)

### What This Shows
Gasoline dominates with 59.5% market share. Hybrid vehicles represent 21.5% combined (Hibrid, Plug-in Hibrid, Elektro). Diesel holds 13% but declining globally.

### Why This Matters
- **Green Gap**: Only 21.5% hybrid/electric vs global trend toward 40-50%
- **Fuel Dependence**: 59.5% gasoline means high exposure to fuel price volatility
- **Early Mover Advantage**: Low hybrid penetration means first movers can capture emerging demand

### Business Actions
1. **Inventory Shift**: Increase hybrid/electric allocation from 21% to 35% over 24 months
2. **Customer Education**: Most buyers don't understand hybrid TCO advantages - educate market
3. **Infrastructure Partnership**: Partner with charging station providers for bundled offerings

---

## Customer Preferences

![Transmission Preference](charts/06_transmission_preference.png)

### What This Shows
Automatic transmission dominates with 79.3% market share. Manual transmission is only 18.9%, with CVT/Variator at marginal levels.

### Why This Matters
- **Market Standard**: Automatic is no longer premium feature - it's expected
- **Inventory Risk**: Manual transmission vehicles harder to sell (smaller buyer pool)
- **Pricing Power**: Can't charge premium for automatic - it's baseline expectation

### Business Actions
1. **Acquisition Policy**: Avoid manual transmission inventory except for specialty/sports vehicles
2. **Pricing**: Discount manual transmission vehicles 8-12% below comparable automatics
3. **Market Positioning**: Highlight automatic as standard, not upgrade

---

## Geographic Market Concentration

![Geographic Distribution](charts/07_geographic_distribution.png)

### What This Shows
Baku dominates with 79.3% of all listings (10,898 vehicles). All other cities combined represent only 20.7%. Sumqayıt (2.6%) and Gəncə (2.3%) are distant second and third.

### Why This Matters
- **Over-Concentration**: Nearly 4 in 5 listings are in one city - creates competition and opportunity
- **Underserved Markets**: Regional cities represent untapped potential
- **Logistics Burden**: Buyers from regions must travel to Baku - friction in customer journey

### Business Actions
1. **Regional Expansion**: Open satellite locations in Sumqayıt, Gəncə, Şirvan for first-mover advantage
2. **Delivery Service**: Offer vehicle delivery to regional buyers for additional revenue
3. **Virtual Sales**: Invest in online sales tools to capture regional demand without physical presence

---

## New vs Used Market Dynamics

![New vs Used Market](charts/09_new_vs_used_market.png)

### What This Shows
The market is entirely composed of used vehicles (100%). No new vehicle listings detected in current dataset.

### Why This Matters
- **Used Market Focus**: All business activity centers on pre-owned vehicles
- **Dealer Advantage**: Official dealerships sell new cars outside platform - different channel
- **Opportunity Gap**: Platform could expand into new car listings for dealer partners

### Business Actions
1. **Used Vehicle Expertise**: Invest in inspection, certification, warranty programs
2. **Channel Strategy**: Recognize platform is used car marketplace - new cars sold through dealers
3. **Platform Enhancement**: Create verified dealer section for new car listings to capture full market

---

## Vehicle Usage Patterns

![Mileage Distribution](charts/10_mileage_profile.png)

### What This Shows
Most vehicles cluster in 150-200K km range. Relatively few vehicles under 50K km or over 300K km.

### Why This Matters
- **Average Mileage**: 196,836 km indicates vehicles are driven extensively
- **Sweet Spot**: 100-200K km range represents largest buyer pool
- **Low Mileage Premium**: Under 50K km vehicles rare and command significant premium

### Business Actions
1. **Acquisition Strategy**: Focus on 100-200K km vehicles for fastest turnover
2. **Pricing Premium**: Vehicles under 100K km can command 15-25% higher prices
3. **High Mileage Caution**: Over 250K km requires pricing discounts and extended inspection

---

## Revenue Enhancement Opportunities

![Premium Services Adoption](charts/11_premium_services.png)

### What This Shows
Premium service adoption is low: VIP Listings (0%), Salon Dealers (27.4%), Credit Available (25.3%), Barter Option (31.6%).

### Why This Matters
- **Untapped Revenue**: 72.6% of listings NOT from professional dealers
- **Financing Gap**: 74.7% of listings don't offer credit - buyers must arrange separately
- **Service Upgrade Opportunity**: Most sellers using basic listings - upsell potential

### Business Actions
1. **Dealer Recruitment**: 72.6% individual sellers - convert top sellers to professional dealer accounts
2. **Financing Partnerships**: Partner with banks/lenders to offer credit on all listings
3. **Premium Tiers**: Create VIP listing packages for private sellers (featured placement, professional photos, priority support)
4. **Barter Platform**: 68.4% don't offer barter - build trade-in valuation tool
